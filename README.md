# Marketing-Probable-Buyers-Analytics

1)Problem Statement

Analysis of the following is required by the Marketing Manager:

The challenge faced by ABC Company in promoting their new line of organic products to their existing customer base while optimizing profitability and market penetration.

ABC Company has shared data on 10% of their loyalty program participants, including their purchase decisions, and has onboarded our team to develop an analytics-enabled marketing strategy to predict the most probable buyers from the remaining 90%. The objective is to use advanced analytics techniques such as machine learning and predictive modelling to analyse customer data and develop targeted marketing campaigns that can increase customer engagement, drive sales of their new organic products, and maximize profitability.
However, ABC Company faces stiff competition in the crowded organic products market, where other retailers are also vying for the attention of health-conscious consumers. Our challenge as consultants is to develop a marketing strategy that effectively communicates the unique benefits of ABC Company's new line of organic products and resonates with their customers.
To achieve this, we will leverage our expertise in analytics and marketing to analyse customer data, develop targeted campaigns, and measure the ROI of marketing efforts. By accurately predicting customer behaviour and preferences, we can tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments, reducing the cost of customer acquisition and maximizing the ROI of marketing efforts.
Overall, our goal as consultants is to help ABC Company develop a data-driven marketing strategy that can effectively promote their new line of organic products, increase customer engagement, and drive profitability.
